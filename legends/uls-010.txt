That's it over there
They use to have a house in there
Right there where the trees is
They use to have a house in there 
Probably got the mark where the house is nah
We used to go in there
We couldn’t go-we use to-we use to travel
We use to hear they had gold there
We’ll go try to dig it, couldn’t dig, couldn’t dig
Me, Dexter, Kenneth, ya daddy
Just about all of us, I think Roland too.
We all tried 
Couldn’t, you couldn’t even get the shovel in the ground
It’s a certain time you could’ve get it in. 
But ya wasn’t finding nothing.
And ya would hear noise in there
Ya hear-ya hear strange noise
There in the trees
Yeah they had some stuff in there.
