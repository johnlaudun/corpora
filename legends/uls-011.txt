Nah I ain’t scared to go over there
I don’t think it’s none to be scared of 
But-but it’s still strange to hear
I think them old people say
 that spirit will not let you dig to get to the gold, whatever’s down there
That’s what them old people used to say
Its not going let ya-and it’s kinda strange they clean all that 
They clean all the distance, but they never clean that spot there
