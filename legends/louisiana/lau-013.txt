One day ... my family was kind of weird. Because they would always try to dig for money. So one day ... I was young, about twelve I guess. So my mother ... couldn’t leave me home, had to take me out there. So we went out there, to a place called the country, some property we had out there, about an acre of land. So they said form a circle. And this is ... my eyes seen this myself. We formed this circle, man. My brother, my brother was preaching. He was digging in the middle. We were all around him and he was digging in the middle. Man, he took that shovel. I guess from the way it looked it must have been a shovel deep, about like this. Something went yanga yanga yanga yang. And then went boom. And when you looked again, they had a fucking coffin, man. Solid gold. Open it up, nothing but coins in there. And then a bull appeared, just appeared out of nowhere. The bull had fire coming out his nose and his eye was red red red. And you hadn’t supposed to talk, because it would break the chain of everything. That’s just how it was. That bull started charging. I was trying to get out of there. I’m young. I don’t know what’s going on. My mother telling me just don’t move. There ain’t nothing, ain’t nothing. You just seeing things. And that sucker come up from me to like where I’m sitting to you and disappeared. Now you know that scared the shit out of me. I was damn near shitting in my clothes. My uncle come up in the car. And when he drove in the yard that shit exploded. And when I looked again it didn’t look like anyone had dug in the ground at all. Everything disappeared.
