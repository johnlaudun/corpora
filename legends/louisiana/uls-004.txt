Upon hearing this, I couldn't help but think of pirates who buried their treasure in southern Louisiana. I learned in history this semester that pirates would bury their treasure on land and ask one of the crewmen to protect it. The one to protect the treasure was shot dead, so that his soul would guard the treasure forever. Perhaps these two stories are connected in some way.
