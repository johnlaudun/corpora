Me and my brothers would hear this story a lot from one of our neighbor’s parents, she said she was a fortune teller. Supposedly, there was treasure buried by a stump and only a child could find it. The treasure would rise up out of the ground and appear to the children. The only time a child could find it is if they were playing by the stump, but if they left to go get help to get the treasure, when they came back for it, it was gone. It had disappeared. It didn’t pay for a grown up to go look for it because they wouldn’t find it.
