That's it over there. They use to have a house in there. Right there where the trees is they use to have a house in there. Probably got the mark where the house is now. We used to go in there. We couldn't go ... we use to ... we use to travel. We use to hear they had gold there. We'll go try to dig it, couldn't dig, couldn't dig. Me, Dexter, Kenneth, your daddy. Just about all of us, I think Roland too. We all tried. Couldn't, you couldn't even get the shovel in the ground. It's a certain time you could've get it in. But you wasn't finding nothing. And you would hear noise in there. You hear ... you hear strange noise. There in the trees. Yeah they had some stuff in there. A spirit.
