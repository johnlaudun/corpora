So, they had this old man, this is like the slave era in Louisiana. Well, not necessarily slave but, you had this era where they had kind of like Jim Crow laws, you know? They weren't born slaves anymore, but they still worked in a kind of indentured servitude, in a kind of fashion. And, he had, this old man he had a couple of "slaves", and what he would do, (he was very cruel, a cruel man, a cruel master. He's very superstitious though) so what he would do if a slave did something wrong, in order to guard his fortune, he would either bury them alive while holding his money, his money or something valuable, and even it would get morbid, like, they had old whiskey barrels, and he would put glass and nails on them and then roll them downhills. He was just cruel. Well, the day that he died they said that he spontaneously combusted and that, nothing else burnt. The only thing that was left of him was a giant suit mark on the bed, where he was. He died in his bed.
