Everyone has heard the story about the young lovers out on loverâ€™s lane, to spice the story, at midnight. We were spell bound.
This couple of teens John and Lisa, were in the family truckster (station wagon), the sky was filled with stars, the moon was full and bright. They didn't think of anything except each other.
The radio was playing the latest head banging hit in an ear bleeding volume level. An announcer came on. "News Flash"
Mass murderer has escaped from Pittsburgh prison. He is 6'2",
189 lbs.
Blonde hair
Black eyes and a shiny silver hook where a left hand use to be.
BEWARE!
BEWARE!
BEWARE ! ! ! ! ! !
Get inside! Lock the doors!
Don't open it please!!
HURRY!!!
HURRY!!!
HURRY!!!
Well the lovers heard this and they believed the radio. "Let's get out of here!!" exclaimed John.
"GO!!" was Lisa's only reaction.
The car wouldn't start, John kept cranking, the car coughed and sputtered to lift. He threw it in gear. They sped away, John was taking Lisa home first, Pulling up to the curb, John got out to walk Lisa to her door. There on the handle was a bloody hook swinging back and forth!
