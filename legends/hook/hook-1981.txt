Mary Beth: Well if the creepy mass murderer has died and is going to come back and haunt us--

[Laughter]
		
Joellen:	Let's have a seance!
		
Jane:	Yeah!
		
Mary Beth: Calling all creepy mass mur--derers!--
		
Jane:	Is Sue going to join in? [Laughs]	
		
Mary Beth: She can be the MEDIUM we'll have her TALK and she'll  holler things out.
		
Joellen: [Laughs; with Mary Beth:] You're next!
	 Well we know it won't be coming from the upstairs extension.
		
Jane:	[Sharp inhale] I know.	
		If it is we're in trouble [ends laughing].
		
Mary Beth: Well no ACTUALLY now-- 		
 		to be ANALYTICAL ABOUT THIS 
	if you're only looking for CLASSIC
		STORIES that are PASSED ON in a
			kind of reverent state
			slumber parties late at night 
				when all the little girls are
					SCARED  
]	The The um
		Couple	
			Parking--
	
	Well OH I've oh I've got one that my
		teacher used to tell-- 
		 
Jane:	He said that [inaudible] the one about the parking?
		
Mary Beth:--uh it's a joke um he I had a teacher I I've heard other teachers 						MENTION it 
			I I don't necessarily think
				it's a TEACHER'S joke but it's more like um	
	the CLASSIC if you want to tell something that's going to flip people
 		out you tell this about--

	 They lived
		in your
			you know
				small town USA
	and he
		dated the little girl next door
			and it was out somewhere in IOWA or something where they had a CORN 
			field
		
Jane:	 How old was the little girl in the story?
		
Mary Beth:    It would have to be you know
		 high school--
			dating-- 
		
Jane:	 Oh I he wasn't like robbing the
		   cradle.
		
Mary Beth:  			and you
					you GOT-- 
	 Oh no! 
	 he got DAD'S CAR and they'd go out and they'd do this and that
	and then you know they'd go out to the  DESERTED ROAD 

	[Laughter] 

		by the CORNFIELD to 
			sit and
				STARGAZE or
	 you know whatever you do on deserted--	
	
Joellen: Watch submarine races.
		
Mary Beth:  I HAVE NO IDEA personally what you would do on a deserted road in a cornfield--
		
Joellen:  Watch submarine races.
		
Mary Beth:	    	--at eleven o'clock at night but um--	
		
Jane:	 Can't see them at night [laughs].
		
Mary Beth:  Um--
		[mock-shy] I I never got to watch.
		
Jane:  It reminds me down by the Olentangy River [laughs]
		Growing up.
		
Joellen: Yeah.	
		
Mary Beth:  Anyways
		 Come to think of it
			I might have seen a little periscope come up[Laughter].
		
Joellen: MARY BETH!
		
Mary Beth:  Anyways--	
		
Joellen: THAT--WAS--  
			BAD!
		
Mary Beth:  Play on words!
		
Jane:	 Go on.
		
Joellen: Go on.
		
Jane:	 Just a little one? 

[Laughter] 
		
Mary Beth:  Tell me about it!
	I was there!
	You know it looks like 
		 HEY COME ON WHERE'S THE REST OF THE SUBMARINE?!

	 [Laughter continues]

	[Heavy irony]  That's--it--o--kay?
	Jacques Cousteau and one of these MINI things that you PADDLE around the ocean on.	

	Jeez. 

	[Laughter]

	You know
		do better with the WHA--LES you know.

	Um--

	 [Laughter]

	 Anyways--	
	No the the man you know 
		takes the little girl out and they're sitting there--

	and
		 of course
			there is the	
				LOCAL--NEIGHBORHOOD--MA---D--MAN

	who runs around and his favorite thing to do is to
		um	
			SLAUGHTER
				people who are PARKING 

	 I mean
		he's probably some um
			anti-sex person or something
		
Joellen: He was rejected [Laughs]
		
Mary Beth:	  			 --like that	
	Yeah
	Well the problem
		there could be a problem with that because um

	for some reason he only had one hand
		And the other one was a hook	

	Now this MAY begin to sound very familiar
		
Joellen: Ah--HA--ah--yes!
		
Mary Beth:   So they're out there parking and and the guy is putting
		SO--ME kind of mysterious moves on the chick which I have NO IDEA what they 		would 	be
	 and she's 
		[Girl’s voice]” Oh honey wow nonono I've got to go home”
	 and he's going 
		[Guy’s voice] “No no you can't”
	 
	and
	and um
		out in the middle of nowhere birds chirping frogs
			crickets you know
	and um--	
		
Joellen:  [High pitched] Chirp chirp chirp chirp chirp--
		
Mary Beth:  Very good.
		
Jane:	[Lower pitched] Ribbit
		
Joellen: No--
	[Even lower pitched] mmeebit. 

[Laughter]	
	
Mary Beth:  And so um
		they hear--
		
Joellen: Was the wind blowing?
		[High pitched] WHOO- -OOSH
		
Mary Beth:			 --strange noises--	
	 No, no wind, no wind--
		just a very quiet night-- 
	and they hear these noises they say 
	 well it's got to be your basic deer
		raccoon
			uh large skunk 
	 			which could be very disastrous
	um--

	[ Laughter]	
		
	  and he's and the chick's saying 
		[Girl’s voice] I got to go home I'm late for curfew 
	 and he goes 
		[Guy’s voice] no no it's nothing it's nothing
	 
	and um
		 I won't go into gory details but
	 		they continue on for a little while and finally the chick says 

	[Deep masculine voice] NO it's MIDNIGHT--
		I'VE GOT TO GO HOME 

	 and um
		the guy goes 
			[Higher-pitched voice]well--	
					--no	
				I I I you know I really don't think this is the time

	and she's going 
		[Deep masculine voice] YES it IS.

	 And all of a sudden the guy's going well what can I say next and they hear 
		[Higher pitched] this really odd noise right beside the car--

	 and he goes 
		[High-pitched feminine voice] you know 
		I think it's time to go home 

	[Laughter]
		
 	    --he just
		TURNS THE CAR OVER		
	uh
	 	Dad's car always starts--

		 [Laughter]

	 and
		JAMS it into reverse and goes
		SPEEDING out with a cloud of dust out of the little deserted road out of the 
			cornfield--	
	
	next time you eat CORN with the dust on it you'll know WHY 

	[Laughter]

	um--and TAKES the chick HOME and 
	 
	of course
		this is you know
		these are OLD people who tell these stories and they had gentlemen we don't 
		HAVE any now--	
			but back then they WERE 

	 he JUMPS out of his car and RUNS around to HER side of the door to open the door for 
	 	her
	
	and there's--a--HOOK
		on--the--door--
	 		with you know the basic little leather strap hanging down from nothing.
		
Joellen:	 I REMEMBER that one.   
		
Jane:	 I forgot all about it.
		
Mary Beth:  That's the end of the story and you can [laughs]
		 it makes you not want to park on deserted roads or corn fields.
		
Joellen:	 Well I never wanted to park any how.	
		
Mary Beth:  Neither did I.

	 [Laughter]
		
Jane:	 I never did.
		
Mary Beth: [Deep-pitched masculine voice] I said look buddy you SHELL OUT FOR THE
	 HOTEL OR--
		I DON'T GO! 

	[Laughter]
