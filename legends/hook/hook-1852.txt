THERE was no west, there was no east,
   No star abroad for eyes to see;
And Norman spurred his jaded beast
   Hard by the terrible gallows-tree.

“O, Norman, haste across this waste, --
   For something seems to follow me!”
“Cheer up, dear Maud, for, thanked be God,
   We nigh have passed the gallows-tree!”

He kissed her lip: then--spur and whip!
   And fast they fled across the lea!
But vain the heel, and rowel steel,--
   For something leaped from the gallows-tree!

“Give me your cloak, your knightly cloak,
   That wrapped you oft beyond the sea!
The wind is bold, my bones are old,
   And I am cold on the gallows-tree.”

“O holy God!  O dearest Maud,
   Quick, quick, some prayers--the bet that be!
A bony hand my neck has spanned,
   And tears my knightly cloak from me!”

“Give me your wine,--the red, red wine,
   That in the flask hangs by your knee!
Ten summers burst on me accurst,
   And I’m athirst on the gallows-tree!”

“O Maud, my life, my loving wife!
   Have you no prayer to set us free?
My belt unclasps,--a demon grasps,
   And drags my wine-flask from my knee!”

“Give me your bride, your bonnie bride,
   That left her nest with you to flee!
O she hath flown to be my own,
   For I’m alone on the gallows-tree!”

“Cling closer, Maud, and trust in God!
   Cling close!--Ah, heaven, she slips from me!”
A prayer, a groan, and he alone
   Rode on that night from the gallows-tree.
