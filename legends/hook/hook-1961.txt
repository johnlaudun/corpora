Miss St. Julien heard this at a slumber party in Vista, California, from girlfriends, circa 1961. It was told as a spook story.
There was this girl in this big house with just her uncle and she was sleeping in bed and she heard this really funny noise. Scrape, scrape, really close and she thought they were probably in the room and so she ran downstairs to get her uncle but by the time they got up there the noise had stopped. So she went back to bed and nothing else happened that night. 
However the next night she heard the same noise again and when she got her uncle it was too late cause the noise had already stopped. Then they heard on the radio that some lunatic had escaped from the nearby mental institution. Now she was really terrified cause she thought it might be this man. And the report also said that he had a hook instead of his right hand.  
She and her uncle formulated a plan for the next time she heard the noise and when it happened again that night she left the room and met her uncle outside he door where they waited for the man to leave and when he emerged through the door, the uncle shot him in the back. Then they went to examine the room to find out what he had been doing. 
When finally they looked under the bed they noticed that it had been all shredded and town. From this they surmised that the man had been trying to rip through the mattress to get at her and rip her to shreds.
