Judging from the following story, perhaps it is unwise to mock the habit of some people to look under the bed with a light before they lie down to sleep.  A German magazine reports:

“An odd experience happened recently to a gentleman staying in a hotel in a town in East Prussia.  In the evening, he undressed for bed, then lay down and smoked while reading a newspaper.  A live ash dropped on the carpet beside his bed, and the gentleman looked over to see if the spark had gone out.  To his horror, he saw a hand come out from under the bed and crush out the spark. He could not believe his eyes; to make sure, he dropped a second batch of live ashes on the floor, and again saw the mysterious hand come and put them out.  He leaped out of his bed, rushed out of the room, and shut the door.  He raised the alarm and insisted that the room be searched.  People came just in time to catch the man climbing out the window into a tree.  He was arrested and confessed that he had planned to rob the traveler during the night.”
