Oh gosh it must have been five or ten years ago. Yea it was ten years ago. I think. Anyway this is a true story. There was this insane killer that was let loose from Nappa Hospital. He didn't have a hand, all he had was one shining silver hook. Really at that time people were really scared of him. All were told in the vicinity to lock their doors and be careful of the killer. He killed two of the armed guards at the hospital and made a silent escape. He found his way over to the Berkeley Hills. That night there was broadcasts on the radio. “Beware of the hooked killer he’s in the Berkeley area. It is advised to stay at home for awhile till he is found and imprisoned.” So any way cone friends of mine were out that night in the hills making out near Indian rock. And it was a perfect night. A full moon and stars and ... They hear this broadcast. The guy turns off the radio. And he tells his girlfriend not to panic. Then he gets curious and turns it on again. "There is a deranged killer and he is referred to as the hook.” He turns it off. And they go back to making out. He goes back to thinking about it. It is still and quiet out there. They are practically in the wilderness so he decides to start the car and it won't start. He tells her not to panic. It is getting really cold and he checks to see if he has his pocket. knife just in case. He doesn't. But he says nothing to her about it. She is scared very easily. Meanwhile it is getting later and he can’t start the car. They begin to hear some strange whistling noises, and feet shuffling. He is really shaking. So he decides to walk out of the car and investigate. He tries to quietly open the car door. And there is a big gash on the side and a hook in the door near the handle.
