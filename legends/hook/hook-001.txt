This is one of those urban horror stories that I believe I heard while I was at a week-long winter camp in the sixth grade, and I remember hearing it a couple of years ago in the Bill Murray movie, "Meatballs". It goes like this:
There's this couple parked out on a deserted lane out near some woods (no specific location was given), and they're making out, with some soft music on the radio. Just when things are getting really hot and heavy between the two of them, an urgent announcement comes over the radio that a psychopathic killer has escaped from the local insane asylum. He's supposed to be about 6'6" tall, with a lot of hair and he's really ugly looking, but the most notable feature about him is that his right hand is missing and in its place is a metal hook. People are urged to keep their doors and windows locked, and not to go out alone. The girl gets really scared and mentions to the guy that the insane asylum mentioned on the radio is only a mile or so away from where they are, and she wants to go home, now. The guy tries to calm her down so they can get back to what they were doing, but she's insistent about going home, and they get in an argument. Anyway, he peels out from where they were parked when she finally convinces him to take her home, and he's furious. The get home and he's still made at her and won't come around to her side of the car to open the door, so she opens it herself and gets out, slamming the door behind her.  As she does so, she notices a large metal hook with some fabric attached to it hanging from the handle of the door!
