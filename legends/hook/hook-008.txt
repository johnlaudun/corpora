I have heard many variations of this story and have heard that it took place about 10 years ago when I was about 10 years old and I heard it took place at the Crocker estate which is nearby where I live, another time I heard it took place out at the Pulgas Water Temple, and only last summer I heard this story again from a guys who lives in L. A. and said it took place In L. A. Each time I assumed it was true.
Supposedly this couple had pulled in to park in some dark woods. The one I remember best was the one by the Crocker Lake or the Crocker estate. The girl was facing the guy and it was a very pleasant night so the windows were open. All of a sudden the girl completely stiffened up but she didn't show it and didn't scream and she leaned over her date and whispered in his ear and pretended she was kissing him and said, "Roll up your window. Very slowly and don't make any moves." The guy was petrified because he didn't know what was wrong. He had no conception, of what was happening and he could tell by the girlâ€™s voice that she was terrified. She said again, "Roll it up but don't turn around." So he reached his left arm around and he Got the handle and slowly rolled the window up. As soon as it was up she quickly reached around and locked the door and did the same on her side. He backed up as fast as he could and took off down the road. As soon as they could stop long enough to recover he looked up in the window and there was this hook that looked like it had been at the end of a man's hand.
I first heard this in about 1955.
