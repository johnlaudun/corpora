This story begins after a girl, and her date, are returning from the movies. They get talking and decide to go to their favorite spot not too far from here.	They began to listen to the radio and do a little necking.	All of a sudden they hear a scratching outside the car.	The boy, trying to act like a man, went to take a look at what made that noise. When he got out of the car he saw a big scrape across the side of the car.	He jumped into the car and took off for home.
After he dropped of his date, he heard something dragging from the bottom of his car.	This time he didn't look to see what it was until he was all the way home.	He went into his house to get his father, and when they looked under the car to see what was dragging, they found a hook with an arm attached.	They called the police to investigate this.	The, police told them that an escaped convict had been in the area this night and that he wore a hook on one of his arms.
The boy took the police out to the place where this occurred and the police searched for days and days but they never found him. Some people say that he is still out there stalking boys and girls to this day.
