The legend goes the person-
it was like a umm, a farm 
that people had lived on that farm 
And the white people killed somebody and buried some money under them to say to protect their money
And during that time
That’s how- I guess- that’s how things had work at the time
But we found out
And we went try to get it
And we could never get it because something was always running around
You could dig but the change 
-You could hear the change falling deeper and deeper and deeper
The more you dig 
The deeper it get
So we never had a chance to get to it.
And I guess no one will get to it
