The most vivid story in high school that I remember is when we went to a wedding in Pocatello of one of our relatives. After we chased the bridal couple all over, we went on top of a hill with a steep winding road. We (my cousins and I-you weren't there, Juanita) wanted to see the city lights below and my cousins who lived there wanted to see if any of their friends were up on the hill parked as it was the "lover's lane."
Carl Cottle, my cousin, was driving and told us about what happened to a friend of his when he had been parked up there with his girl friend.
 The girl friend says she hears a noise and that someone is out there. The boy friend says that there are no other cars around and that she just heard a twig break in the wind. No one is out there. The girl friend says she can feel someone is there but he says that she is imagining things. Then he starts to hear the noises also. Then the moon comes from behind a cloud and he sees a shadow moving. (Carl was making all the appropriate sounds while he is	telling us.  At this point in the story all of us in the car insist we leave and start down the winding road. Carl continued the story as we were driving away.)
The boy and girl become very frightened at the sight of the shadow so he starts the car suddenly and guns the motor to leave quickly. By the time he gets his girl friend home they have talked themselves into thinking they were just afraid of shadows and it wasn't anything.
The boy walks around the back of the car to open the door and. he sees a hook hanging on the back bumper of the car. Itâ€™s the kind of hook that fits on a man's arm. He grabs the girl and they run into the house. They turn on the radio and hear a report that a crazy man from Fort Hall is loose. He has only one arm and a hook for a hand on the other arm, and everyone should be on the lookout.
