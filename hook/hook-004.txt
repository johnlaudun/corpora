One time a young couple was parked down at the light [The “Spook Light,” which appears near Joplin, MO], waiting for the light to shine. And the boy looked across to the girl's side of the car and looked out of the window. And all of a sudden just turned pale and instantly started up the car and drove to the nearest... oh, four or five miles to the closest public thing, a service station. And he got out of the car, and he was shaking and trembling, and she kept saying, "What happened, what happened." He was so afraid he couldn't speak. And finally he got himself together and calm and he said, "I looked outside your window and I saw this horrible, grotesque figure that was ... had a... instead of a hand, a hook for a hand and was trying to get into the car. It just scared me so much. I just could drive off the cliff." And the girl said, "Oh, it probably wasn't real. It was just an illusion." "No, it was real." She tried to calm him, and finally, at that time, he walked around to her side of the car, and there, hanging on the door was the hook with meat hanging off of it.
