A curious story is told by the Vienna correspondent of the London News.  A young man, the representative of a large firm, who carried a large sum of money with him, recently spent the night at a hotel in Presburg.  As usual, he remained some time smoking in bed.  Suddenly the burning cigar fell to the floor.  He bent over to extinguish it, when he saw a hand projected from under the bed to put the cigar out.  It made him very uncomfortable.  He lay awhile and they saying, aloud: “How very cold: I shall get my fur coat,” he jumped out of bed, flew to the door and called for help.  The would-be robber was caught.  He confessed he knew the occupant of the room had money, which he hoped to get while he slept.  He had been a fireman formerly, and could not resist the impulse to extinguish the burning cigar.
