"There was a guy who was in the hospital for the criminally insane, and he escaped, and he had a hook, his right hand had been cut off, so he had a hook on his right arm. And a girl and guy were parking by a lake and were watching the 'submarine races' and a cop came by. There were several cars there and he told them about this guy who had escaped and suggested that they leave since he was in the area.
The guy was like, 'yeah, sure'. But everybody else left, but he was like 'no problem' - he wanted to make-out.
They were sitting there. The girl was uptight but the guy was like, 'Don't worry about it. He's a million miles from here'. But then the guy was getting nervous, too, since the girl was so uptight, but he was trying to act really cool. Then they heard this sound like footsteps  - it was a nice night so the windows were rolled down. The mood was so intense that the guy was like, ‘Let’s get outta here.'
So he slammed the car into reverse, pulled outta there and took off. They were driving down the road, laughing about how silly they were for being scared. Finally he took the girl straight home since the mood had been ruined.
He got out of the car to go to open the girl's door. He walked around and as he went to open the door he fainted. The girl freaked out and opened the door and jumped out of the car. She slapped his face and woke him up and she said, 'What's wrong?' He pointed at the door and she turned around. And there was a hook dripping blood hanging from the door handle."
