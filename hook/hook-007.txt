A high school girl and her boyfriend parked on a lover’s lane off of Fish Ranch Road in the hills above Oakland, California. The girl and the boy began necking. Soon, the girl felt that the situation was about to get out of hand because the boy was getting pretty passionate. The girl then asked her boyfriend if he had ever heard about the man who had a hook for a hand who supposedly prowled around the lover’s lane where they had parked. The boy said no so the girl told him the following story: "There is a man who prowls around Fish Ranch Road looking for parked lovers. If he finds a parked car he sneaks up and opens the door, kills the boy and rapes the girl." Just as the girl finished the story, the couple heard a scratching at the car door. The boy turned and saw a man’s face at the window. In fright the boy started the car, threw it in gear and peeled out. He took the girl straight home. When he walked around the car to open the door on the girl's side of the car, he found a hook dripping with blood hanging from the door handle."
