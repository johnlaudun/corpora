"This is one about Organ Grinder Road, and the ole Hookman. A few guys went out there, they didn't believe in all this crap, at least they called it crap, I never called it crap. But they went out there and uh, they went uh back on the road quite a ways where there's always fog on the part of the road. It gets lower and it's always foggy there. And so that's where they stopped the car and got out. They got out and walked around and walked towards the woods a little bit. And they, uh, heard these noises like somebody coming through the woods, kinds fast, so they got sorta scared and they figured they better get by the car in case any thing happened. Pretty soon at the edge of the woods they saw this, uh this, the Hook Man. They could tell it was the Hook Man cause they uh, the hook reflected off their tail lights cause the parking lights were still on and so they decided uh, they'd all jump in the car and get the hell out of there. They all jumped in and they had to turn the car around on the middle of the road. By the time they got it turned around Hook Man was right up to the car. He ran up to the car and they were peeling out of there and uh, the Hook Man managed to hook, get his hook into the door. It almost went right through the door. It did put a hole in the door and then, then uh, they just left. And that was the truth, the Hook Man really did come after them. 'cause there was a hole left in the door.
