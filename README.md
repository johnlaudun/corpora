# Corpora

Corpora is probably not the best of names for this collection of collections of texts, but it will do, since I didn't think of calling it *collections* until just now.

Some of these collections have been collected from elsewhere, and if there being included in this repository is problematic, please let me know. This repo is mostly meant for my own use, to make it easier to work on various machines and always have various kinds of text collections available to test out ideas and methods. It's also useful when I am demonstrating something to a participant, or participants, in a course I am teaching. Thus the intent of this collection of materials is purely for personal or instructional use.
